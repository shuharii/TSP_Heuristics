# Traveling Salesman Problem Heuristics
# Formal Languages and Automata Theory Project


### This project developed with [Cansel Samast] and achieved 100/100 grades.

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem and currently we do not have a  fast  algorithm  for  its  solution,  known  algorithms  are  exponential.  In  this project  you  are going to implement heuristic algorithms for the solution of TSP. Heuristic algorithms do not guarantee to return the optimal solution; however, they return good enough solutions in a reasonable time.

The specific TSP problem you willattempt to solvecontains 4,663 Cities in Canada. The XY coordinates of the cities are given in the attachment. Thefigure below shows these citiesin the XY-plane.

The shortest tour length is 1,290,319 and it is shown visually below.

You are requiredto implement (either using C++or Java) three heuristics given below:

      1.Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
      2.Greedy Algorithm
      3.Divide and Conquer Strategy

All of the above heuristics are described in 
https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/TSP.ipynb.

As explained in the grading section we will sort alltheprojects according to the differenceof their best resultto the shortest tour and 20%of the points will be givenaccording to this sorted list. In order to improve your position in the sorted list, you can try different techniques (other than the three heuristics given above). You can find extra resources on the Internet or you might think of improvement strategies by yourself. 


**What tosubmit?**

     a)A video recording in which you present your project and each team member explains his/her contribution(video should be at most 10 minutes in total). The format of the video should mp4.
     b)A report (in PDF format) which contains the following information:
        •The results of the TSP heuristic algorithms. In the results you should report the tour, its length, the time, and a visualization of the tour for each heuristic.
        •If you use methods other than the three heuristics given above, you should also describe them in your report.
     c)Code of the project.
     d)Submit your files through itslearning system. Late submissions will get lower grade by 10% for each day.
     e)Make a single submission for each groupand provide the group member namesat the top of thereport.

**Grading:**

     a)70%:Correctness(whether you correctly implemented all the three heuristic algorithms). Clarity of code will be also important.
     b)20%: Distance to shortest tour. We will sort all projects according to their best resultto the shortest tour and distribute these points (20%) according to this sorted list. The closest one will get all the points and the last one will get no points. Clearly present your best result both in the report and in the video presentation.
     c)10%: Project report.

**Important Notes:**

     a)The project is at most 3 PERSONsize. We encourage everybody to work in groups.
     b)You should implement the project using either C++or Javalanguage.For visualizations you can use Python.
     c)You can use libraries,but you mustimplement the heuristics by your
